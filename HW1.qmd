## Data Science

What is being a data scientist about?
What is the difference between a data scientist and a statistician?
- List the differences
How do I view myself in relation between the two areas?

## Running Code

Creating new object y to store the density of the Petal width data within the built-in data set Iris.

```{r}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)
```

Determining the class, type of, and structure of the object y

```{r}
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

We can see that y has the class of density and it is a list of seven variables.

Plotting y

```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(y)
```

The density of iris petal width is plotted.
